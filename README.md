# Tents-and-Trees-Prolog
ðŸŒ² â›º Tents and Trees: An AI Project in Prolog â›ºðŸŒ²

Tents and Trees is a solo grid puzzle game (NxN). The elements are tents, trees, and grass, with the objective of following specific rules to find the solution.

##  The rules are:
  -Pair each tree with a tent adjacent to it, either horizontally or vertically.
  -There is one tent for every tree.
  -Tents never touch each other, not even diagonally.
  -The numbers outside the grid indicate the number of tents in that row/column.

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a logical AI capable of solving all possible Tents and Trees puzzles.

## Course Information
This project was developed for the Logic for Programming subject.

__Note__: The game is in Portuguese (due to project specifications), but it is easy to understand.

Enjoy :)
