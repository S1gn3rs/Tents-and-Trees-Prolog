# Tents-and-Trees-Prolog
ðŸŒ² â›º Tents and Trees, an AI done in Python, 2Âº Project By Logic for Programming course subject â›ºðŸŒ²

Tents and Trees is a solo grid puzzle game (NxN). The elements are tents, trees and grass, simple as that, with objective of following some rules to get the solution.
  
  The rules are:
    -Pair each tree with a tent adjacent to it, either horizontally or vertically.
    -There is one tent for every tree.
    -Tents never touch each other, not even diagonally
    -The numbers outside the grid indicates the number of tents in that row/column.

  This project has the objective of developing a logical AI capable of solving all the possible puzzles.


  NOTE: the game is in Portuguese (due to project specifications) but it's easy to understand what it means.

Enjoy :)
